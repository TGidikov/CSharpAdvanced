Present Delivery






Now that the presents are ready, Santa has to deliver them to the kids. 
You will receive an integer m for the count of presents Santa has and an integer n for the size of the neighborhood with a square shape. On the next lines you will receive the matrix, which represents the neighborhood. 
Santa will be in a random cell, marked with the letter 'S'. Each cell stands for a house where children may live. If the cell has 'X' on it, that means there lives a naughty kid. Otherwise, if a nice kid lives there, the cell is marked by 'V'. There can aslo be cells marked with 'C' for cookies. All of the empty positions will be marked with '-'.
Santa can move "up", "down", "left", "right". These will be the commands that you receive. If he moves to a house with a nice kid, the kid receives a present, but if Santa reaches a house with a naughty kid, he doesn’t drop a present. If the command sends Santa to a cell marked with 'C', Santa eats cookies and becomes happy and extra generous so all the kids around him* receive presents (doesn’t matter if naughty or nice). If Santa has been to a house and the kid there has received a present, the cell becomes '-'.
Note: *around him means on his left, right, upwards and downwards by one cell. In this case Santa doesn't move to these cells or if he does, he returns to the cell where the cookie was.
If Santa runs out of presents or you receive the command "Christmas morning", then you have to end the program. 
Keep in mind that you have to check whether all of the nice kids received presents.
Input
•	On the first line, you are given the integer m – the count of presents
•	On the second – integer n – size of the neighbourhood
•	The next n lines hold the values for every row
•	On each of the next lines you will get a command
Output
•	On the first line:
o	If Santa goes out of the neighborhood, print: "Santa ran out of presents."
•	Next print the matrix.
•	In the end print one of these messages:
o	If he manages to give all the nice kids presents, print:
"Good job, Santa! {count nice kids} happy nice kid/s."
o	Otherwise print: 
"No presents for {count nice kids} nice kid/s."
Constraints
•	The size of the square matrix will be between [2…10].
•	Santa’s position will be marked with 'S'.
•	There will always be at least 1 nice kid.
•	There won't be a case where the cookie is on the border of the matrix.

Good job, Santa! 2 happy nice kid/s.	Santa has 5 presents. The size of the matrix is 4. After we receive the matrix, we start reading commands. The first one is "up". The "X" means there is a naughty kid, so Santa moves on without dropping any presents. Next he reaches a nice kid and drops a present. The "down" command moves Santa to an empty cell. The last command before the "Christmas morning" message is "right". Again we have a nice kid. The count of nice kids reached 2 and we don't have any nice kids without presents left. So we print the appropriate message.

No presents for 1 nice kid/s.	The commands send Santa to a cell with a cookie, so all of the kids around him receive presents. He runs out of presents because we have 3 kids there and only 3 presents. The program ends and we have 1 nice kid that hasn't received a present.
