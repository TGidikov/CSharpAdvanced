Santa's Bag of Presents
 
Can you imagine Santa without his special bag that carries presents for so many children? Neither can we. So let's have a quick sneak peek inside it and help  Santa rearrange it.
Preparation
Download the skeleton provided in Judge. Do not change the StartUp class or its namespace.
Problem description
Your task is to create a repository which stores presents by creating the classes described below.
First, write a C# class Present with the following properties:
•	Name: string
•	Weight: double
•	Gender: string
The class constructor should receive name, weight and gender. Override the ToString() method in the following format:
"Present {name} ({weight}) for a {gender}"
Next, write a C# class Bag that has data (a collection which stores the entity Present). All entities inside the repository have the same properties. Also, the Bag class should have those properties:
•	Color: string
•	Capacity: int
The class constructor should receive color and capacity, also it should initialize the data with a new instance of the collection. Implement the following features:
•	Field data - collection that holds added presents
•	Method Add(Present present) - adds an entity to the data if there is room for it
•	Method Remove(string name) - removes a present by given name, if such exists, and returns bool
•	Method GetHeaviestPresent() - returns the heaviest present
•	Method GetPresent(string name) - returns the present with the given name
•	Getter Count - returns the number of presents
•	Report() - returns a string in the following format (print the presents in order of appearance):	
o	"{color of Bag} bag contains:
{Present1}
{Present2}
(…)"
Constraints
•	The names of the presents will be always unique.
•	You will always have a present added before receiving methods manipulating the Bag’s presents.
Examples
This is an example how the Bag class is intended to be used. 
Sample code usage
//Initialize the repository (Bag)
Bag bag = new Bag("Blue", 20);
//Initialize entity
Present present = new Present("Train", 0.4, "Boy");
//Print Present
Console.WriteLine(present); // Present Train for a Boy

//Add Present
bag.Add(present);
Console.WriteLine(bag.Count); //1
//Remove Present
bag.Remove("Doll"); //false

Present secondPresent = new Present("Doll", 0.7, "Girl");

//Add Present
bag.Add(secondPresent);

//Get heaviest present
Present heaviestPresent = bag.GetHeaviestPresent(); // Present Doll for a Girl
//Get present
Present searchedPresent = bag.GetPresent("Train"); // Present Train for a Boy

Console.WriteLine(bag.Report());
// Blue bag contains:
// Present Train for a Boy
// Present Doll for a Girl
